 <h1>Instructions</h1>
 <h3>Placing Checkers:</h3>
 <p>
   To place checkers on the live-board, click either the “white” or “black” button above the board based on which color checker
   you’d like to place. The player whose move is being analyzed may be either color. Clicking these buttons will put you into a
   mode where every blank checker on the board that is clicked will be colored based on the mode you are in. To switch modes,
   simply click the button corresponding to the new mode you would like to be in. Use these instructions to model out the board
   position you would like to be analyzed.
 </p>

 <h3>Deleting Checkers:</h3>
 <p>
   To delete a misplaced checker, click on the “delete” button to the right of the “black” button. This will put you into “delete”
   mode, where each checker you click will revert back to an un-assigned color. Alternatively, you may click the red "Clear Board"
   to reset the board to its beginning, untouched state. This button can be found to the right of the “Get Best Move” button above
   the board.
 </p>

 <h3 class="red-text">**Board Orientation:</h3>
 <p>
   To ensure your position is correctly analyzed, you must input a position oriented where the player’s whose move is being analyzed
   has his #1 point in the bottom right. This means that for this players game, he is moving counterclockwise, with his #24 point in
   the top right. If you are playing a game where you have chosen the bottom left to be your #1 point, simply mirror the position so
   that it follows this criteria.
 </p>


 <h3>Dice Roll:</h3>
 <p>
   In the text entry box above the board, input the dice roll that you would like to analyze. You must input this in the format “#,#”.
   This format is shown beside the box on the evaluate page as a reminder.
 </p>


 <h3>Submitting Position:</h3>
 <p>
   When you have followed these steps and correctly inputted the position into the live board, click the blue button “Get Best Move.”
   As long as there are no error messages, the engine will run the position and return its solution!
 </p>


 <h3>Understanding the Suggestions:</h3>
 <p>
   After submitting the position, the interactive board will show the top engine move by highlighting which points are involved in the
   move. There will be highlights for the points where the involved checkers are starting as well as landing. Below the board, there
   will also be a verbal description of the top 1-3 best engine moves. This information clarifies the move for the user as well as
   provides additional information like other top moves, winning percentage, gammoning percentage (winG), and backgammoning percentage (winBG).
